# doge_vsm.rb - Department of Government Efficiency using VSM paradigm
#
# VSM Architecture Benefits:
#
# 1. Identity System
#
# - Defines DOGE's core purpose: government efficiency optimization
# - Establishes invariants ensuring quality and evidence-based decisions
#
# 2. Intelligence System
#
# - AI-ready for LLM integration with sophisticated system prompts
# - Handles conversation flow and tool orchestration
# - Extensible for advanced reasoning capabilities
#
# 3. Operations System - Three Specialized Tools:
#
# - LoadDepartmentsTool: Handles YAML parsing and data extraction
# - SimilarityCalculatorTool: Performs similarity analysis with multiple metrics
# - RecommendationGeneratorTool: Generates detailed consolidation plans with cost estimates
#
# 4. Governance System
#
# - Validates analysis quality (not too few/many combinations)
# - Enforces minimum value thresholds for recommendations
# - Provides policy feedback on analysis quality
#
# 5. Coordination System
#
# - Manages workflow between analysis stages
# - Handles message scheduling and turn management
#
# Key Improvements Over Original:
#
# 1. Separation of Concerns: Each VSM system has specific responsibilities
# 2. Tool-based Architecture: Individual tools can be tested, reused, and extended
# 3. AI Integration Ready: Intelligence system prepared for LLM-driven analysis
# 4. Policy Enforcement: Governance ensures quality standards
# 5. Async Processing: Built on VSM's async foundation for scalability
# 6. Extensibility: Easy to add new analysis tools or modify workflow
#
# Enhanced Output Features:
#
# - Estimated cost savings calculations
# - Consolidation theme analysis
# - Implementation roadmaps
# - Policy validation alerts
# - Rich summary statistics
#
# The VSM paradigm transforms the monolithic DOGE class into a sophisticated, extensible system that's ready for AI integration
# and provides much richer analysis capabilities!
